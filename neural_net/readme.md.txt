A simple feed forward Neural Network built with keras layered over tensorflow which will classify the users into 4 categories depending on their physical attribute and the userrecall data.

This network composed of 1 input layer with 100 nodes, 1 output layer and 2 hidden layers having 60 and 30 nodes with sample size of 5 and the model have 300 epochs. 

ReLU is used for hidden layer activation function whereas Softmax is used for the final output layer as it is the classificatoin problem.

This neural network only calculates its accuracy , script for external input and prediction will be added in further.
